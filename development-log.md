## STATUS UPDATE 11/09/2019

Ran into a major problem today with the code at home (one of the major downsides, working from home!). I finally got the blackjack classes working but the code was a bit of a mess. The menu isn't looping properly and keeps breaking. Fixed it by the good old method of brute force. It took me a long time to figure it out, but I was so happy when I finally did. I must've ran it at least 50 times before it started to run flawlessly again. I also managed to make the code look a bit nicer and less convoluted.

Ended up implementing a number of deck feature, just for extra difficulty. Took a while to figure out how to code it but had a friend with a programming background help me. This was done by using a methods/classes. Also had a problem with github, and have not been able to upload anything to it. Problem still remains unsolved. Definitely need to do it the second I go into class on Monday.
